## About the simulator
ARGoS — http://www.argos-sim.info
* Written in C++, open source
* Multi-robot simulator
* Multi-threaded
* Multiple sub-spaces, each with a different physical engine
* It allows cross-compilation
* Controllers programmable also in Lua

In this course, we will use the latest version of ARGoS (argos3).
